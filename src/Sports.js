            <p className="p3-india">
                <img className="imagep1-home" src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/5a247f8d6f822844123c1f20/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Karawau-River-GettyImages-79472343.jpg" alt="Bunjee Jumping"/>
                New Zealand practically invented adventure sports when the Kawarau Bridge Bungy opened in 1988. Here you join around 38,000 annual visitors to take the 140-foot jump from the South Island's historic, steel-framed Kawarau Bridge. Like Australia, New Zealand has been strict about border closings throughout the pandemic, but those dives will be waiting for you whenever travel resumes.
                Jumpin Heights is currently India's Highest Bungee jumping in Risikesh, at a height of 83 mtrs. This is also India’s only fixed platform Bungy- performed from a professional cantilever, to separate it from entertainment parks, and create instead, an extreme adventure zone.
                The Bungy jumping experience has been set amidst the astoundingly stunning landscape of Rishikesh: The Cantilever platform is built over a rocky cliff over-looking the river HALL, a tributary of River Ganga. Bungy-ing amidst the vastness of nature lends the experience an absolutely breathtaking quality.
                Experience the adrenaline thrills of bungy jumping with a bungy jump off the Waiau Ferry Bridge in Hanmer Springs. Located less than 2 hours from Christchurch, the Alpine mountain town is a Mecca for fans of adventure activities, such as jet boats, quad bikes, paintball, white water rafting, and much more. Make your way to the bungy jump base for a briefing on how to jump off the 135-year-old Waiau Ferry Bridge. At 35 meters high, the jump is perfect for first time jumpers, or those looking for a lighter jump. Launch yourself into thin air as you plunge down towards the river.

                <p className="p1-india">
                    <img className="imagep2-home" src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/5a247f2344d6de730ff9430d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Antarctica-GettyImages-91657948.jpg" alt="Camping in Antarctica"/>
                    Antarctica is truly the final frontier when it comes to adventure travel, providing untouched landscapes, unique wildlife, and more activities than you'll know what to do with (cruising, caving, and thermal spring soaking to name a few). If you can get yourself to Punta Arenas, Chile, Antarctic Logistics & Expeditions will fly you to Antarctica for three days of skiing and hiking before setting you up for a South Pole sleepover.
                    Typically camping in Antarctica is charged as an optional extra. The cost varies from one ship to another, but you should budget for between $150 and $300 per person. However, it's worth being aware that it’s included in the voyage price on a small number of ships and select departures.

The good news is that the vast majority of voyages offer camping on Antarctica as an optional add-on. However, as the number of spaces is typically limited, the best thing to do is to ask us to check availability and secure your places at the point of booking your trip.
Anyone can camp in Antarctica - regardless of age or fitness levels - and no prior experience is required. All you need an adventurous attitude and a couple of extra layers of clothing.

Overnight camping on Antarctica is commonly available on the majority of Antarctic Peninsula departures and for the experience is a well-priced optional add-on. As the group size is typically limited (up to approx. 30 people), it’s important to secure your camping places at the point of booking your cabin.

                There's perhaps no better way to explore America than with a good old-fashioned road trip. Many of the country's national parks are perfect for a multi-day drive, like Virginia's Shenandoah National Park and Alaska's Denali National Park. But if we had to pick just one itinerary, we'd go with the Mighty Five, the cluster of Utah's national parks that include Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Arches, and Canyonlands. The Mars-like landscapes here must be seen to be believed, and the journey can start anywhere from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas.
                Experience the rugged and wild West during this 9-Day tour. Start in Jackson, a posh city just outside of Yellowstone National Park, where you will walk beside the rainbow-hued hot springs and watch Old Faithful spew water more than 120 feet into the air. In Cody, see a firearms collection at the Buffalo Bill Center. Travel to Devils Tower, a butte of igneous rock jutting from the craggy Black Hills mountains. Here, you will also join a Local Expert for a Deadwood tour, where you’ll learn about the Western legends Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane. Then head to Mount Rushmore National Memorial, where the visages of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt are carved into the mountainside. And ascend 563 feet to the top of Crazy Horse Memorial, named for the Lakota warrior, and stand face-to-face with the world’s largest mountain carving.
                Explore America's top national parks on this 15-Day guided tour. After an evening in Scottsdale, start your journey in bohemian Sedona, where spiritual seekers and nature lovers alike will revel in its red-hued mountainous landscape. Take a short jaunt to the Grand Canyon, where a Local Expert will show you the wonders of America’s most famed natural beauty.

                <h2 className="heading-island"><NavLink to="/Booking.js" className="heading-link-island">Paragliding</NavLink></h2>
                <p className="p1-india">

                    Oludeniz has one of the most beautiful beaches in Turkey, with pebble shores and a “blue lagoon” of aquamarine hues. The beach also happens to be one of the world's best places to paraglide, thanks to stable weather and gorgeous panoramic views. The launch site for most companies is from Babadağ mountain, with jumping-off points reaching 6,000 feet above sea level.
                    The dream of flying in the sky just like a bird is as old as human kind. You can make your dream come true with paragliding. This sport is considered to be risky, but the reality is that the safety of practitioners is quite high, especially compared to other adventure disciplines. Of course, you cannot paraglide unless you have undergone extensive training. There are numerous paragliding schools that you can select from. It is only natural for you to look for courses in your local area, but there are a number of other essential factors that you have to consider carefully as well.
                    The first thing to decide on is the type of paragliding that you want to practice. The glider is made from one canopy. The entire mechanism represents the one of a parachute. The gliding principle is the same. However, given that the paraglider is lighter and more portable, it is easier to fly. You can readily start training for this discipline in any of the paragliding schools. Once you master the necessary skills, you can you can start on your own.
                    Powered hang gliding is also an option. As its name suggests, the flying requires the use of a motorized hang glider. It should be noted that this discipline is not easier. You need to learn how to hang glide first in order to extend your skills to do powered hang gliding. You can also sign up for a course that teaches you how to fly with a paramotor.

                The dunes of the Sahara are colossal, untouched, and tailor-made for extreme sports. The desert's rows of barchans (meaning “crescent-shaped dunes” in Turkic) have ideal shapes for sand surfing (descending the slopes on a surfboard) and sandboarding (descending the slopes on a snowboard)—and those views don't hurt, either. Stay at Erg Chigaga Luxury Camp in Morocco, which offers sandboarding in addition to other desert activities like camel rides and quad biking.
                Extreme sports are getting more and more popular each day. Sand surfing, also known as sandboarding, is one of the newest extreme sports discovered in the search for adrenaline. Be ready to kick up some dust with sandboarding on the great sand dunes of the world. 

Sand surfing is a sport of balance like surfing, skateboarding, and snowboarding. The difference between these board sports and sand surfing is the environment. It is done prevalently in deserts and coastal areas. It’s birthplace is Egypt and since then it became popular in the countries that have deserts or beaches with sand dunes. 

Surfing on the sand sounds fun but it has its difficulties. It is hard to build a ski lift for participants to go up on the sand dunes easily. You can attend to the organized tours that have all-terrain vehicles for this reason. Unlike snowboarding, sandboarding is not a seasonal sport and you can do it any time of the year.
If you are a beginner at board sports and want to do sandboarding, it is better to start practicing with skateboarding. Most of the professional snowboarders and sandboarders start with skateboarding. You can skateboard in your neighborhood and learn how to balance yourself on the board first. And then slowly practice controlling your speed while you are riding down of the hills and jumps from ramps. Physical exercise is another necessity for these sports. Some snowboarders recommend Bosu Ball training to learn soft landings. This training also will strengthen your muscles for good balance.

                    Mount Everest looms large, known around the world by hikers and non-hikers alike. But this is one behemoth that is best left to truly experienced travelers. According to alpinist Adrian Ballinger, who attempted the climb in 2016, “You need to climb at least three 20,000 peaks, one 23,000 peak, and one 26,000 peak before considering Everest.” But hey, if you're one of the lucky few who has the experience, time, and funds needed to reach Everest's summit, then by all means, do it. This year's climbing season (March to May) has already ended, but you'll need that extra year to prepare anyway.
                    Welcome to a diminutive, amicable nation of amazing extremes is Nepal. There are the highest Himalayas including Mt. Everest and many other mighty mountains. Due to the best geographical distribution and variation in altitude, very rare species of flora and fauna are inhabitants of this green land. A rich culture, different types of ethnic groups, peculiar traditions, innocent and friendly people are the precious ornaments of this nation. So, a person who enters this land proudly says, "I am in the Paradise of the Earth". The breathtaking landscapes, snow-capped peaks; fantastic eye-catching panoramic view attracts everyone to fall in love with its beauty. Monterosa Treks and Expedition is operateing exploratory tours in Nepal.

So it is expecting for the chance to serve our respected guests, Trekkers, Mountaineers, River runners, Wildlife enthusiasts, scholars or explorers. At this moment, we would like to inform all our guests and groups, that Monterosa Treks and Expedition has been providing excellent service for the last two decades.

            <h2 className="h2-international"><NavLink to="/Booking.js" className="h2-link-international">Hunt for Glaciers in Greenland</NavLink></h2>
            <p className="p3-india">
                <img className="imagep1-home" src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/60d20f85303d7ca9bcab2912/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Adventures%2520to%2520Have%2520in%2520a%2520Lifetime-2021_Glaciers%2C%2520Greenland_GettyImages-1203568212.jpg" alt="Glacier Hunting"/>
                Greenland is relatively expensive and tricky to get to, but well worth the effort—especially since it's one of the most untouched landscapes on the planet. Exhibit A: the hundred-year-old icebergs and glaciers floating off the mainland, which you can get up close and personal with during a cruise excursion. (Try Hurtigruten or Cruise Norway.) 
                he beat of a double-time waltz, ocean currents push the icebergs along a counterclockwise path that circles Baffin Bay, leads south through the Davis Strait, and eventually passes Newfoundland on the way to the open Atlantic. According to local legend, the iceberg that sank the Titanic likely calved near Ilulissat, the Cape Race’s embarkation point and the third-largest town in Greenland, with a population of 4,500. What we’re seeing on the first leg out of Ilulissat—icebergs the size of cars, houses, cathedrals—is only a prelude to grander sights to come, Cape Race owner Milos Simovic tells us as he steers from the ship’s bridge. “These aren’t big ones,” he says. “Wait till we’re farther north.”
                Spotting icebergs on this seven-day cruise along Greenland’s coast will be like spotting game on an African safari: It may not be quite the entire point of the trip, but it’s compulsory and, as Simovic notes, compulsive. As I watch the views spool past, I’m reluctant to step away for the same reason I wouldn’t leave a movie theater during a momentous scene: There’s a sense that something important is happening, constantly.

                <h2 className="heading-island"><NavLink to="/Booking.js" className="heading-link-island">Go on a Canoe Safari</NavLink></h2>
                <p className="p1-india">

                    Going on safari in Africa is a no-brainer when it comes to seeking adventure, but where exact='true'ly do you start? Botswana's Okavango Delta is a must for first-timers and experienced safari-goers alike, thanks to its wealth of wildlife and topographical diversity. Hop on a mokoro canoe for the best, most intimate look at the roaming elephants, antelope, and cheetahs, among others. Stay at Xigera Safari Lodge, one of the most anticipated recent openings on the continent. You can expect 12 new elevated suites, a baobab tree house for sleeping under the stars, and tons of measures to make the property as eco-friendly as possible.
                    You’ll regularly encounter big game in the form of elephants, hippos and crocodiles in the water. A canoe on the water won’t disturb the buffalo, kudu and eland, and predators including lions and other large mammals can be seen along the river banks and shorelines. You’ll find a fantastic array of resident animals and birdlife through the season. The October to March period that has the most migrant animals travelling through the area.

Our canoe trips are often self-supporting with wild-camping on isolated islands, or we spend nights in fully supported mobile fly-camps. We can also make use of comfortable permanent lodges to start or end a canoe safari adventure.

Canoe safaris are generally very active but prior canoeing experience isn’t essential, and a reasonable degree of fitness will certainly help. We set out on the water just after sunrise, break for brunch and siesta in the early afternoon heat, then paddle through the afternoon to catch sundowners in camp before the sun sets. Our ‘bush TV’ comes by way of a primal camp fire.
